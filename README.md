## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

One of the biggest challenges encountered while building the app was the XCode interface. 
Connecting the elements to the editor in order for it to work with the code was new to me, which took a bit of getting used to.
The overall interface of XCode was also very overwhelming, but overtime easier to understand.
